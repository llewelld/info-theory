Information Theory notes and docs

## Python Examples

The Python examples are available from [James Stones's website](https://jamesstone.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/books/information-theory).

The examples here have been amended to work with Python 3 (as opposed to Python 2.7).

## Install dependencies

To install the dependencies needed for the examples, use something like the following.
```
git clone https://github.com/llewelld/info-theory.git
cd info-theory/example-code
python3 -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install pip --upgrade
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the examples

After installing the dependences you can run the examples directly.
For example:
```
python infotheory1_6.py
```
